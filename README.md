## 2019
This repository contains the solutions in Python to the puzzles of the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about).

I also tracked my progress/struggle in a [diary on Medium](https://medium.com/@olegkomarov_77860/a-commented-journey-through-the-advent-of-code-2019-by-an-average-joe-257bbf4855d7). Although it tries to be introspective, the diary contains spoilers.
